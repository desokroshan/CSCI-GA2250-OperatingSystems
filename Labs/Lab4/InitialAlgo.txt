Following is an initial Algo Idea:

Two methods mainly
- Main method to act as the Driver;
- A Pager Routine

Data Structures:

Algorithm:

- Read the input and store it in Data Strucutres
- Print the input
- While the queue is not empty(we need to have a queue for the processes)
	- get the first element
	- q=3
	- while(process's remaining reference!=0 or q!=0)
		- invoke Pager(with required reference information)
	if (process remaining reference==0){do not add to the queue}
	else(q==0){Add to the queue}
*************End of main Algorithm*********************

Pager Routine(with required reference information):
- if page not in the frame table:
	if no empty frame:
		invoke Page replacement Algorithm
	empty frame: just update the frame table

The Algorithm needs more refinement:
